## Password Generator Javascript Challenge

This challenge was to add functions, if then statements, and variables to the Javascript code to generate a password based on the users critera they selected. 

This challenge required asking the user:
How many characters would you like your password to include?
Asking the user to use special characters, numeric characters, uppercase characters, and lowercase characters.
Depending on the user's answers, the password generator will provide a random password with the criteria you have selected.

During this challenge, I came across multiple challenges with the Javascript code. There was starter code provided, which I used to determine what steps needed to be taken next. 
The generate password button was not working. 



## User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
